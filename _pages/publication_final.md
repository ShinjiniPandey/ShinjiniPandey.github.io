		We evaluate the effectiveness of two widely adopted police response models for behavioral health crises in the US: Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) for police, and co-response (joint police and non-police response) programs. Despite their widespread adoption, no rigorous evaluation has measured the impact of either model on crisis outcomes. In Columbus, Ohio we conduct such an evaluation by: (1) Using police dispatch data to examine the causal impact of crisis response by CIT-trained officers or by Mobile Crisis Response (MCR) teams vis-à-vis standard police response, and (2) Conducting interviews with individuals who have recently called 911 for a behavioral health crisis to evaluate their experience with standard police and/or MCR teams, and elicit their opinions about improved crisis response models. The quantitative analysis addresses endogeneity of triaged response via two-stage-least squares strategies that exploit quasi-random variation in officer precinct/shift assignments and in MCR capacity to answer calls. We find that while MCR teams spend more time handling crisis calls and generally improve the experience of response for those in crisis, they do not improve call disposition or service linkages. Preliminary results suggest that CIT training also has little meaningful effect on outcomes. Interviews reveal significant heterogeneity in the quality of police response to mental health crises, and variation even in the quality of MCR response. Our research indicates that both CIT training and co-response may be less impactful than policymakers wish to believe.

		During 2023 in Columbus, Ohio, 30 semi-structured interviews with community members impacted by police response to 911 calls for behavioral health (BH) crises found variation in the demeanor of responding police within the same neighborhood, pervasive reluctance to call the police during BH crises, and strong support for a non-police response program–making specific recommendations for its structure. Given this, while non-police response models proliferate across the country, the community should be engaged in model development and impact studies.

		India’s Public Distribution System (PDS) is the largest food-based social safety net in the world, and many in India argue that it should be universalized rather than targeted based on household income. We use a natural experiment to ask whether universalizing PDS in the Indian state of Odisha improved access to PDS entitlements and ultimately women’s health. In 2008, the Odisha government simultaneously increased PDS entitlements and universalized access to the PDS in the particularly poor Kalahandi-Balangir-Koraput (KBK) region. In the rest of the state, the government increased PDS entitlements for poor households in an equivalent manner, but did not universalize PDS. We exploit this variation in reform implementation and and find that while universalization had little effect on women’s health (BMI) in above poverty line households, it improved health in below poverty line households. We also examine the mechanisms that drive these improvements in health.

              <h5>Monetary Policy, Economic Uncertainty, and Firms R&D Expenditure</h5>
            </a>
            <div class="articles">  This paper studies the state-dependent effect of monetary policy shocks on firms
research and development (R&D) expenditure in the US economy. Empirical results
suggest that a 20 basis point increase in the interest rate decreases the aggregate R&D
expenditure by 0.6 percent. Furthermore, using Compustat firm-level data, I show a
persistent decline in US firms’ R&D expenditure in response to contractionary monetary
policy shocks. The effect on R&D expenditure is stronger for interest rate hikes and
when firms face higher uncertainty. Economic uncertainty decreases firms’ leverage ratio
and makes them more financially constrained. As a result, firms become more responsive
in their R&D investment following a contractionary monetary policy shock. I use
a medium-scale DSGE model with endogenous output growth and financial frictions to
interpret the empirical results. The theoretical model highlights the importance of the
credit channel for altering the effects of monetary policy on firms’ investment in R&D in
the presence of economic uncertainty.
