I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Ohio State's [Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics](https://aede.osu.edu/home "Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics"). My research revolves around issues of program targeting and technology adoption in developing countries. In particular, I am studying the impact of targeting a food security program on nutrition outcomes in India. In another study, I examine how different payment methods influence smallholder farmers willingness to pay for solar irrigation in Ghana. Besides development, I am also interested in the economics of policing. I am currently working on a project that is evaluating different police response models in Columbus, Ohio to determine their impact on outcomes for mental/behavioral health crises. 

I have completed my Masters in Economics from [Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research](http://www.igidr.ac.in/ "Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research") and Bachelor of Commerce from [University of Delhi](http://www.du.ac.in/ "University of Delhi"). Before starting my Ph.D., I was working as a research assistant at [International Food Policy Research Institute](https://www.ifpri.org/ "International Food Policy Research Institute").<br /> <br />
