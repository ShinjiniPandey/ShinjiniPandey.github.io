I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics](https://aede.osu.edu/home "Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics") at Ohio State University, currently on the 2024-2025 job market. 

I am an applied microeconomist specializing in labor and development economics. My research in policing and public safety examines factors that influence the delivery of an effective and equitable police response. I study how racial and ethnic identity of individuals involved in emergencies affects 911 call handling by dispatchers and how de-escalation training and co-response with mental health professionals impact police response to behavioral health crises. Another strand of my work in development evaluates the impact of universalizing a food security program on beneficiary participation and nutrition outcomes.
