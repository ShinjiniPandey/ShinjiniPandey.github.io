I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics](https://aede.osu.edu/home "Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics") at the Ohio State University. I hold a Master's in Economics from [Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research](http://www.igidr.ac.in/ "Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research") and a Bachelor of Commerce from [University of Delhi](http://www.du.ac.in/ "University of Delhi"). Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant at [International Food Policy Research Institute](https://www.ifpri.org/ "International Food Policy Research Institute").<br />

I am an applied microeconomist interested in topics of policing and public safety, nutrition and health, and women's empowerment. In my work on policing and public safety in the United States, I utilize natural language processing and administrative police data to examine issues within the current system and provide evidence-based insights on improving  police response to 911 calls. My job market paper investigates racial biases in 911 dispatch decisions and its implications for the quality of police response received. I am also evaluating the effectiveness of alternative police response to behavioral health crises, such as mental health training for officers and co-response with social workers, in improving call outcomes. Another part of my research involves primary data collection and household survey analysis to assess the impact of various interventions and policy changes on women's nutrition and empowerment in India. This work has led me to gain valuable fieldwork experience in India and Ghana.
