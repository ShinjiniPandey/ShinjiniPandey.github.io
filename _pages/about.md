I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics](https://aede.osu.edu/home "Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics") at Ohio State University, **currently on the 2024-2025 job market**. 

I am an applied microeconomist interested in labor and development economics. 

My research in policing and public safety in the United States seeks to understand what factors facilitate or impede an effective and equitable police response. I study how the racial and ethnic identity of individuals involved in emergencies affects 911 call handling by dispatchers, and how de-escalation training and co-response with mental health professionals impact police response to behavioral health crises. Additionally, another strand of my work in development focuses on food security, nutrition, and sustainable agricultural practices.
