I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics](https://aede.osu.edu/home "Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics") at the Ohio State University. As an applied microeconomist, my research focuses on topics of public safety, nutrition and health, and gender equality. 

My work on policing and public safety in the United States investigates race-based and behavioral health-related disparities in police response using machine learning and econometric analysis of police administrative data. My job market paper investigates racial bias in 911 dispatch decisions and its implications for the quality of police response received. I am also evaluating the effectiveness of alternative police response, such as mental health training and police co-response with social workers, in improving call outcomes for behavioral health crises. 

Another strand of my research in the field of development centers on women’s welfare outcomes and has involved assessing the impact of a food targeting reform, self-help-group participation, and behavior change communication interventions on women’s nutrition and empowerment in India.
